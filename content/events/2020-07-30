# Front End Columbus Screencast Group Discussion - Job Searching in a Pandemic

Come join us for our bi-weekly Front End Columbus meetup! This meetup will focus on group discussion. We have a few topics to seed the discussion with this week:

- Entering the industry and job-searching in the middle of a pandemic
- What are the first skills to focus on when starting off in front end?
- What topics are you interested in seeing presented on by this group?
- What's new in the world of front end that you're excited about?
- What are you currently working on or learning in school?

Please note, we will be using Discord for this meetup (link below). We encourage everyone to join our Discord community so we can keep the conversation going even after the event!
