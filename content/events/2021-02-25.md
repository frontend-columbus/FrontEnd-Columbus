# Live Coding With Marko: Let’s Build a Synthesizer in React!


Let’s build a synthesizer in React! In this session we’ll be leveraging the power of the Web Audio API to build a simple monophonic synthesizer with a filter, envelope controls, and reverb. Our synth will run entirely in the browser and use browser native APIs to generate all the sounds. The session will be a live collaborative coding format and last around 2-3 hours total with plenty of time for discussion and questions throughout. A starter repo will be shared out at the beginning for those that want to follow along.
